# RemoteCompanion — AI Scripting Guide

Use this guide to generate action sequences with any AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).

## How to use AI to build a sequence

**Copy this prompt, fill in what you want, and paste it into any AI:**

```
Read this guide: https://github.com/saihgupr/remotecompanion/blob/main/SCRIPTING.md

Using the action format defined there, create a RemoteCompanion sequence that:
[DESCRIBE WHAT YOU WANT — e.g. "pauses music, takes a screenshot, waits 2 seconds, then plays music again"]

Return ONLY the raw JSON array. No explanation, no markdown, no code fences.
```

Then copy the JSON output, open RemoteCompanion → your trigger → Import, paste it in, and hit Import. Done.

## Format

A sequence is a **JSON array** of actions. Each action is either:

- A **string** — a simple command
- A **dictionary** — a structured action (if/else, Lua script)

```json
[
  "play",
  "delay 2",
  "pause"
]
```

## Advanced: Structured Actions

These use a JSON dictionary instead of a plain string.

### Lua Script
Run arbitrary Lua code on the device.

```json
{
  "type": "lua",
  "script": "rc.execute('play')\nrc.sleep(1)\nrc.execute('pause')"
}
```

> In the app, Lua actions appear as `Lua <your code>` strings. For import, use the `Lua ` string prefix format:

```json
"Lua rc.execute('play')"
```

### If / Else Condition
Branch based on device state or time of day. Supported conditions: **front app**, **time of day (between)**, **lock status**, **player status**, **wifi**, **bluetooth**, **airplane mode**, **vibration**, etc.

```json
{
  "type": "if",
  "conditionKey": "time_between",
  "conditionTitle": "Time of Day",
  "expectedValue": "09:00 - 17:00",
  "expectedTitle": "9:00 AM – 5:00 PM"
},
"volume 25",
{
  "type": "else"
},
"volume 75"
```

- Everything after `"type": "if"` up to `"type": "else"` runs when the condition is **true**
- Everything after `"type": "else"` runs when the condition is **false**
- Omit the `else` block if you don't need a fallback

## Full Example

Pause if Spotify is open, otherwise play — then wait and take a screenshot:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "if",
    "conditionKey": "front_app",
    "conditionTitle": "Front Application",
    "expectedValue": "com.spotify.client",
    "expectedTitle": "Spotify"
  },
  "pause",
  {
    "type": "else"
  },
  "play",
  "delay 2",
  "screenshot"
]
```

## Tips for AI prompts

- **Be specific**: "pause music, wait 3 seconds, lock the screen" beats "do media stuff"
- **Say "return only the JSON array"** — keeps output clean for pasting directly into Import
- **Bundle IDs**: If you need to open a specific app, tell the AI the bundle ID (e.g. `com.apple.mobilesafari` for Safari). If you don't know it, ask the AI.
- **Delays**: Add `"delay 0.5"` between fast actions if the device needs time to respond
